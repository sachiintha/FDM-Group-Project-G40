# **Customer Churn Prediction**
1.	BACKGROUND

For subscription-based companies, churn rate is a useful statistic. Businesses can learn about weak points in their products or pricing strategies, operational problems, consumer preferences, and expectations by identifying customers who are dissatisfied with the solutions they are receiving, thereby proactively reducing reasons for churn.
creating a procedure for churn prediction The following steps make up the general scope of a standardized ML project structure that is used to construct an ML-powered application to forecast client attrition:
We chose a challenge in the telecommunications industry for our FDM project since we were required to provide a solution to a real-world problem utilizing machine learning methods..


2.	PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

When a consumer stops being a customer, that is, decides not to utilize your goods or services, this is known as customer attrition, also known as customer churn. The customer churn rate is the frequency with which customers stop utilizing your services. Every business encounters customer turnover; the goal is to determine the causes and reduce your churn rate.
To employ a typical metaphor, churn analytics helps companies plug the hole in their customer bucket. Many businesses prioritize gaining new clients above preserving their existing clientele, and they are unaware of the cost of client churn until it has done serious harm to their bottom line. If a company gets new users at a loss and they don't become paying customers, it may be challenging for the firm to earn a profit. This frequently occurs with commercial or user-generated apps that heavily spend in advertising. The team there may use churn analysis to assess the worth of customers, the price at which it makes sense to acquire them, and come up with suggestions for enhancing retention and customer lifetime value. 
3.	TARGET AND BUSINESS GOALS

Every business and endeavor are motivated by a certain set of goals and destinations. These might be long- or short-term, and they can be focused on achieving significant, tangible achievements or more original outcomes. Despite the fact that they are often used interchangeably, there are some pretty important differences between objectives and goals that everyone in business, especially project managers, has to be aware of. Our final objective with this project is to observe the predictive analysis of customer segmentation to determine on which customer segment the manager should primarily concentrate in order to enhance company possibilities and profit.

4.	Classification Model

When working with our data that accumulates to a binary separation, we want to classify our observations as the customer “will churn” or “won’t churn” from the platform. A logistic regression model will try to guess the probability of belonging to one group or another. The logistic regression is essentially an extension of a linear regression, only the predicted outcome value is between [0, 1]. The model will identify relationships between our target feature, Churn, and our remaining features to apply probabilistic calculations for determining which class the customer should belong to. 

This churn prediction operated under the fact that every customer is different and .Company also gained a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences.

This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. By analyzing historical data of customers, we can accurately predict whether the customer will churn or not. This will help manager to save time and money because he is able to focus on what to do to keep the customers who are more likely to churn.
